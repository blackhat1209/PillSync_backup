# PillSync

**Intelligent Medicine Reminder and Medication Tracking Platform**

An AI-powered platform for managing medicine schedules, tracking dosage adherence,
predicting refill requirements and keeping long-term medication history — built for
patients, caregivers and administrators, with chronic disease management in mind.

This repository is the shared workspace for a **26-person AI internship cohort**.
Each intern builds the full platform on their own branch.

> **Interns: read [INTERN_GUIDE.md](INTERN_GUIDE.md) before you write any code.**
> It covers branch naming, the workflow, what CI checks, and the milestone deadlines.

## How this repository works

| | |
|---|---|
| `main` | Skeleton, CI pipeline and instructions. Maintained by mentors — **read-only for interns**. |
| `intern/NN-firstname-lastname` | One branch per intern. All of your work lives here. |
| Pull requests | **Not used.** Nothing is merged into `main`. Your push is your submission. |
| Review | Automated on every push by the [CI pipeline](.github/workflows/ci.yml), plus mentor review at each milestone. |

The 26 branch names are listed in [`.github/interns.yml`](.github/interns.yml).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GKSJ-Deepvision/PillSync.git
cd PillSync
git checkout -b intern/NN-firstname-lastname origin/main
```

Then follow [INTERN_GUIDE.md](INTERN_GUIDE.md).

Everything at once, with Docker:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
docker compose up --build
```

---

## Automated checks

Every push to any branch runs [`CI`](.github/workflows/ci.yml):
branch policy · file hygiene · secret scan · structure and progress · YAML/JSON syntax ·
backend lint, format and tests · frontend lint, tests and build · notebook hygiene ·
Docker image build.

Checks skip themselves when the code they cover does not exist yet, so an early-week
branch is not punished for being early. See
[INTERN_GUIDE.md § What CI checks](INTERN_GUIDE.md#5-what-ci-checks-on-every-push).

## For mentors

Repository settings that the pipeline cannot enforce on its own — branch protection,
collaborator access, Actions permissions, the weekly cohort report — are listed in
[`docs/mentor-setup.md`](docs/mentor-setup.md).
